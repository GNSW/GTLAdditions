* Only coils of Titan-grade or higher may be used;
* The operational cycle lasts 3 seconds;
* If energy continues to enter whilst the internal energy buffer is full, a massive explosion will occur centred on the machine;
* At the start of the operational cycle, an instantaneous, extremely high-power EU pulse (1 tick) is injected into the internal energy buffer, followed by a smooth discharge of lower power into the buffer for the remainder of the cycle;
* After the pulse ends, the internal energy buffer will output power to the external environment via the power bay/laser source bay:
* The Stellar Thermodynamic Container tier affects the internal energy buffer capacity:
> Basic: 54,120,000,000,000 EU \
> Advanced: 3,475,000,000,000,000 EU\
> Ultimate: 1,160,000,000,000,000,000 EU
* Coil tier affects the type of fluid consumed, the consumption rate per cycle, and power generation (power generation data is based on the highest-tier coil in the group; for each tier reduction, both instantaneous and discharge values are divided by 16)

* Right-click to insert one into the machine via the handheld <ItemLink id="gtmthings:creative_laser_hatch"/> to activate special overclocking mode:
> The operating cycle is reduced to 1s; all energy is output directly to the wireless grid, and the maximum single-shot output current is increased to 64A MAX+16, regardless of coil level and internal buffer
